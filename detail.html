            <p>A Little Bit About Me:</p>
            <p>Meet Baxter, a lovable Beagle with a knack for sniffing out fun! Baxter was
            rescued from a shelter and has blossomed into a friendly and outgoing boy. He
            loves long walks and has a keen sense of smell. He's great with kids and other
            dogs, making him the perfect family pet. His favorite pastime is chasing squirrels
            in the park and curling up for naps. Baxter is looking for a loving home where he
            can share his endless affection and playful spirit.</p>
